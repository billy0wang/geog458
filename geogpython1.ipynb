Because of this, packages like [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/), [scipy](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scipy/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), have all become common packages in the\n"," toolkit of a python developer. numpy and scipy are commonly used in pre-processing and data aggregation and cleaning, as their intended strength is scientific computing, they come loaded with a lot of mathemtical operations as well as various data structures. Pandas, in my experience\n"," is commonly used for data analytics and builds upon the strong data structures introduced with numpy and scipy and also piles on additional statistical algorithms. Matplotlib is a very common data visualization package usually used towards the end after results have been derived\n"," so as to present findings and conclusions.\n","\n"," B) As I touched on briefly, just as charts, graphs and other data visualization models are commonly generated through ggplot in R, the same\n"," visualizations can be achieved through [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) in Python. Standard charts, graphs, etc are all the same. Customization and functionality are all retained,\n"," they're might be some small shifts in syntax, but they are pretty similar on a holistic comparison.\n","\n"," C)As also mentiond earlier, the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) package is the go-to package for data analysis in Python, and I think is the most\n"," widely recognized as employing data frames just as ubiquitously as in R. Dataframes are built off vectors just like in R, and are used for everything stretching from collection, and organization, to interaction and data manipulation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Task 3\n"," We see things like if and else if in R turn into if and elif in Python.
