In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated 
by the equation $E=mc^2$, discovered by Einstein and heralded as a pillar of modern quantum mechanics and general relativity.

## Loading Data 
This is how to load data into R and how to convert it 
```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
object1 = read.csv("China_EO_49to17.csv")
object2=as_tibble(object1)
by_year_desc <- object2[order(-object2$Year),]
beijShang2000 <- filter(by_year_desc, Year >= '2000') %>% select(Year,Beijing_Enterprise, Beijing_Output, Shanghai_Enterprise, Shanghai_Output) 
print(beijShang2000)
beijShang_withRatio <- mutate(beijShang2000, Output_Ratio = Beijing_Output / Shanghai_Output)
print(beijShang_withRatio)

##Function that creates a table including the Enterprise & Output of the two input provinces for years above 2000 
province2000 <- function(province1, province2) {
  output <- filter(by_year_desc, Year >= '2000') %>% select(Year,paste0(province1,"_Enterprise"), paste0(province1,"_Output"), paste0(province2,"_Enterprise"), paste0(province2,"_Output"))
  return(output)
}

test1 <- province2000("Shanxi", "Hebei")
print(test1)
test2 <- province2000("Sichuan", "Yunnan")
print(test2)
```
